# Introduction

CNN-based small bowel lesion classification and XAI-based localization

- DL platform conversion (to Pytorch) and Code modularization
- Including experiments for master's thesis (Yunseob Hwang - Convolutional Neural Network Based Small Bowel Lesion Detection in Capsule Endoscopy, POSTECH, 2021)

# *AI feedback Process
- AI model's inference can be used to collect training samples rapidly with reducing Experts' labeling cost 
- Eventually, it implies that this process could allow the AI model to be robust for itself
- Extended AI Research Fields: Active Learning, Online Learning, Continual Learning, AutoML...
